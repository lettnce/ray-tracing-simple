rgb triplet(pixel) is produced in each iteration

ray class implements the ray as a function and allows
P, the position of the ray in 3D space, to change
depending on A + tb, with A being the ray's origin
and b being the direction. T is an arbitary scalar,
however, for positive T, you get part of the ray
above A, and vice versa (half-line).

graphics trick to scale 0.0 <= a <= 1.0;
ex: when a = 1.0 -> blue
	when a = 0.0 -> white
	between -> blend
	
blendedValue = (1 - a)*startValue + a*endValue;
a from 0.0 -> 1.0
